# Huggingface Authentication

Many models from [ðŸ¤— Huggingface](https://huggingface.co) are freely availble. For instance our default reranker model (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`) and our default embedding models (`jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en` and `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) are freely available without authentication. However, certain models, transformers from [MistralAI](https://huggingface.co/mistralai) such as `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1`, require you consent to the author's terms of service, and that requires authentication.

## If you are unauthenticated

If you are unauthenticated and try to access a model that requires authentication, you will see an error like this:
```

## To authenticate

You have two options:

### Option 1: Huggingface CLI

You can authenticate by running the following command:
```sh
huggingface login
```

### Option 2:Create a token file

You can skip the Huggingface CLI and create a token file manually. Create a file at `$HOME/.cache/huggingface/token` and populate it with your token.

```sh
echo 'hf_your_token_here' > $HOME/.cache/huggingface/token
```

Once you've authenticated and consented to the terms of the model, you should be able to use it.
